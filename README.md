The repositories hosted here are forks of open source repositories that we use in our products or have used in the past. 
We use these repositories to
- publish code changes we made to these projects as required by some open source software licenses,
- send pull requests to the original repositories.

All code changes are published under the same license as the original repository.

If you have any questions about these projects or would like to contribute, please contact the owners and maintainers of the original projects.
